## Renting a house is not a long-term alternative to buying a house

In recent years, China has seen a surge in its housing prices. The high housing prices are not affordable to everyone, thus forcing many youngsters to rent a house, temporarily or for a long time, rather than buying it. However, renting a house cannot possibly be a long-term alternative compared with buying it.

Above all, in Chinese traditional ideas, there is no such thing as ‘family’ when you do not even own your own houses. Many parents would not want to marry their daughters to men who do not have their own houses. This can be the major reason why many youngsters nowadays struggle to buy a house even with loans.

Secondly, renting a house can sometimes also be expensive, especially when you want to live cozily. After one makes his down payment for a house, the monthly mortgage can be as much as the rent per month. After one pays off his mortgage, he can get his own house. While one can get nothing after he pays many years of rents.

Thirdly, house renting is much less stable than buying. There are many changes during renting that can force renters to find a new one unwillingly. For example, the renting prices go high beyond the renter’s affordability, or the landlords do not want to rent their house anymore. On the contrary, once you buy a house, it is your own properties at least for 70 years, and no one can force you to leave your own properties.
In conclusions, though house renting seems to be cheaper alternatives to buying, there are actually many implicit costs behind house renting; therefore, renting a house is not a long-term alternative to buying a house.
